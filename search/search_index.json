There are even rumors that security is vital to our existence as a company. No, really, I've heard that. And when you do security right that means security certifications and security certifications mean training and, well, that's where your day got changed.\n\n\nMy name is Mark Kroh and I lead our technical L\nD programs. Welcome to the Red Ventures annual security awareness training! Over the next hour or so, we'll go over the most important things you'll need to know to help keep yourself, our data, and our future safe. We'll try to do this as painlessly as possible, so let's get started.\n\n\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\n\n002. Goal of the training.\n\n\nOk, we all understand that security certifications are important to the business. But our philosophy is that what is MORE important is doing things the right way because that is who we are at our core. We want to keep people's data safe. We want to have confidence that when our partners place their trust in us, we will deliver.\n\n\nThe goal of today's training is to make sure that we can maintain and build partner trust by having a staff who is well training against the most common security threats that we face. It's not just about knowing what threats we're up against, it's about knowing how to protect us from those threats too.\n\n\nDespite our best efforts, the security team can't have eyes everywhere. We rely on all of you to help us to spot security issues and let us know about them.\n\n\n\n\nTestimonial\n\n\n\n\n003. Testimonial for the training.\n\n\nIf this is your first year at Red Ventures, then this training will be new to you. Actually, even if you've been here since the founding in 2000 this training will be new to you because we've never done it before. However, moving forward, we'll be swinging around to this annually. Not the most thrilling prospect for many of you but we've really tried to make this as entertaining and enjoyable as possible, and it's my hope that you don't feel this is a waste of your time. The material I'm going to present should be useful no matter what skill level you already have. Whether you're just joining us as an intern, or are a seasoned security expert.\n\n\n\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n004. Classification ratings for these slides.\n\n\nBecause this information is so valuable, we're going to produce a public version of the slides that you can share with family and friends. Each slide contains a classification level based on the information present in the slide. I'll be producing three versions of the training at the end, one of which will be a public version you can share however you like.\n\n\nAny slide with a green icon and the word \"public\" can be shared however you like. However, if it's red and says \"internal only\", it's not to be shared with anyone outside of Red Ventures under any circumstances.\n\n\nI've included real examples of ongoing attacks in some of the material, and we want to be sure we don't tip our hand to attackers that we're on to them.\n\n\n\n\nClassification Demo\n\n\n\n\n005. Showing where slide classifications are located.\n\n\nIf you're unsure where to look, it's down here in the bottom left. For example, this slide is \"public\".\n\n\n\n\nThe Security Team\n\n\n\n\n006. Security Team.\n\n\n\n\nAndre Mintz, Chief Information Security Officer\n\n\nRaghu Kotha, Director of Engineering\n\n\nCarla Sweeney, Director\n\n\nJim Sabinske, Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Job\n\n\n\n\n007. Our job as a security team.\n\n\nWhy does the security team even exist? Despite what you may think, we\u2019re not here to say \u201cNo\u201d to everything, or to chastise you for doing something \"wrong\". We\u2019re here to keep Red Ventures secure, and to make it easy for you to do the right (i.e. secure) thing automatically. Never be afraid to come to us for help, or to let us know you may have done something that put us at risk. We\u2019d rather know about it than not! If we've implemented a security feature that has made your life unnecessarily more annoying, we want to know about that too, since our goal isn't to add features that make your lives harder.\n\n\nWe're not here to be a bottleneck either. You'll notice that user access reviews don't go through the security team, and we don't have to sign-off on everything security related. Teams are trusted to make their own decisions (within reason).\n\n\n\n\nTracking Attendance\n\n\n\n\n008. Blue.\n\n\nOne of the new things this year, due to our size, is that we need to track attendance for this training. Typically this is done by either getting everyone to scan their access cards, or by taking roll call. Sometimes it's about sending a survey asking questions about the material and if you answer incorrectly you have to resit the training. We're not going to do any of that, because.. well, because I didn't like any of those options.\n\n\nInstead, I'm going to satisfy the constraint of tracking attendance in the silliest way possible. At the end of this training, you will get a survey with only two questions. \"What was the color?\" and \"What was the animal?\". Yes, there will be a slide at the end with an animal on it.\n\n\nBy answering both questions correctly, this will \"prove\" you attended the entire training.\n\n\nOf course, yes, I know this can be gamed. Yes, I know you can cheat. This seemed more fun than any of the other options, and at least makes a good faith attempt at providing evidence you stayed for the entire training. Honor system here folks, I'm trusting you all to help me out here and make this easy.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\n\n009. Bike locks.\n\n\nNow a quick question to get things rolling. Let's say you're the healthy type, and you like to cycle around the city. You are somewhere around the streets of Charlotte, and need to secure your bike. You have two choices, you can just leave it on the street without any lock at all, or you can take the morning off work and use 100 locks instead. Which do you choose?\n\n\nHopefully, you've realized that both of these answers are absurd and aren't going to work. Using no lock leaves you with no security at all and your bike won't be there when you return, whereas using 100 locks will leave your bike very secure, but you'll need to take the day off in order to lock and unlock it.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity vs Convenience\n\n\n\n\n010. Security vs convenience.\n\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that there's a trade-off between security and convenience, with two extreme ends of a spectrum. Too far one way, and we're not secure, too far the other, and we're secure but completely unusable. If you get a bunch of people in a room and ask them if they want to be secure, they'll say yes. But given the choice between being secure and having convenience, most folks opt for convenience.\n\n\n\n\nBe Secure, But Usable\n\n\n\n\n011. Be secure, but usable.\n\n\nOur job is to strike a good balance between the options. We want to make sure that Red Ventures as a product/service/partner, and as an office environment, is both secure and usable. Our goal is not to add friction to your day-to-day jobs, but we can't sit entirely at the convenience end of the scale either. So while we may force you into following certain procedures, please know that it's not because we like annoying you, but it's because we don't really have a choice.\n\n\n\n\nNo Faking\n\n\n\n\n012. No faking.\n\n\nImportantly, we never want to fake security. Putting a sign saying you have a burglar alarm on your front lawn when really you don't might deter a few criminals, but anyone who really wants to steal something will just ignore it anyway.\n\n\n\n\nFaking is the Path to the Dark Side\n\n\n\n\n013. Yoda, dropping some knowledge on fake security.\n\n\nFaking security leads us down a dark path, and will give us a false sense of security. There are multiple ways to fake security. Some terms you may have heard of are \"Security Through Obscurity\", where the secrecy of the implementation is being relied upon. Imagine a padlock manufacturer coming out with a padlock they say is unbreakable. You want to look inside to see how it works, but they say \"No no no, you can't do that, that would give away the secret. You're not allowed to look inside!\". Criminals, of course, being well known for following the rules.\n\n\nAnother term you may have heard of is \"Security Theatre\"...\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Theater\n\n\n\n\n014. What is security theater? \nReference\n\n\nThis is where you spend time and effort on things which merely give the \nappearance\n of improved security, without actually providing it. A lot of people hold up the TSA as an example of this, but I want to use the TSA as another example of where bad security came to bite them.\n\n\nA \"backdoor\" is another type of fake security. This refers to when there's a supposedly secret method of bypassing the security of something, typically only given to a few people.\n\n\n\n\nTSA Baggage Locks\n\n\n\n\n015. Story in the Washington Post. \nReference\n\n\nYou may remember a news story a few years ago in the Washington Post. It was around Thanksgiving, and they had an article all about how the TSA keep your bags safe during the holiday period. They held up TSA locks as an example. You've probably seen these locks, where you have a code or key to unlock it, but the TSA have some master keys to also unlock it. The article included a photos of these master keys. Quite a high resolution photo in fact. So I'm sure you can guess what happened next.\n\n\n\n\n3D Print TSA Master Keys\n\n\n\n\n016. Print your own TSA master key from the comfort of your own home. \nReference\n\n\nYep, you can now 3D print your own TSA master keys in the comfort of your own home.\n\n\nAny security provided by these locks are now ineffective. You might still deter a few folks, but anyone who's determined to get in your bags will now have a much easier time of doing it.\n\n\nBackdoors pop up all over the place. Do any of you have a modem provided by your ISP? Pretty much every one of them has a backdoor on them for the purposes of customer support. A secret password that the customer support agents know, usually derived from your modem serial number in some way, that gives them the ability to change settings if you call them up. A lot of times attackers can figure out the patterns used and also get access to your modems. Google \n\"ARRIS modem backdoor\"\n if you want to read about one example.\n\n\nHopefully you're starting to see why faking security is a bad thing, and something we want to stay away from.",

Seriously, why wear a balaclava while on the phone? It makes no sense!\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Social Engineering?\n\n\n\n\n018. What is social engineering? \nReference\n\n\nFor those who've not heard the term before, here's a quick definition of what social engineering is. Basically it's a type of confidence trickery. Convincing people to give up information either without them realizing it, or by making them believe you're someone else.\n\n\n\n\nCatch Me If You Can\n\n\n\n\n019. Catch Me If You Can. \nReference\n\n\nIf you've ever seen the movie \n\"Catch Me If You Can\"\n (or read the book) you will have seen lots of examples of social engineering. \"\nFerris Bueller's Day Off\n\" is another one. If you've not seen either of those movies, I'd highly recommend giving them a watch. The link at the bottom of the slide here is to a \ntalk by Frank Abagnale Jr\n, the real person on which Catch Me if You Can is based. He tells the story of his exploits. It's quite entertaining and eye opening.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Trust\n\n\n\n\n020. Building Trust.\n\n\nSocial engineering is mostly about building trust. If I wanted to social engineer the CEO of Red Ventures, Ric would not be my first phone call. I'd start by calling a low-level employee claiming to be a new employee needing help, or I'd call a new employee and claim to be an established employee asking for help. I'd learn some little bits of information, maybe a bit of internal lingo that's being used. Then the next person I call would be slightly higher up the chain, I'd use the information I learned on the first call to sound more credible. And so on and so on.\n\n\nBy the time I call the CEO, I'd have so much internal knowledge and language for the company that it would sound like I was an employee anyway.\n\n\nThis is hard to defend against, since human nature is to want to help others. So if someone contacts you claiming to be an employee, and you've never heard of them before, verify they are who they say they are via another channel. If they email you, ping them on Slack to check (and vice versa).\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Directory\n\n\n\n\n021. Redacted slide.\n\n\nAnother way to verify if someone works here is to check the \nEmployee Search\n on the Red Ventures' intranet. A bonus of doing this is seeing some of the truly horrific first-day mug shots we take!\n\n\n\n\n~~Fishing~~ Phishing\n\n\n\n_022. ~~Fishing~~ Phishing.\n\n\nI'm going to focus on one particular type of social engineering attack that we get exposed to, phishing (with a P-H), and again, this is another one of my favorite stock images. The term comes from \"fishing for information\", and generally involves receiving an email designed to trick you into giving up information. As we get larger as a company, we become more of a target for these types of attacks.\n\n\n\n\nNigerian Prince Scam\n\n\n\n\n023. Nigerian Prince Scam.\n\n\nSome phishing attacks can be pretty easy to spot. You've all likely heard of the Nigerian Prince Scam. This is where an email claiming to be someone who can give you lots of money is sent to lots of people. This is a very \"spray and pray\" approach to scamming. Maybe 1 or 2 people will bite, but that makes it worthwhile enough for the scammer. These are pretty easy to spot, and not something we really worry about. Hopefully none of you would ever fall for something like this.\n\n\n\n\nIs My Credit Card Stolen?\n\n\n\n\n024. ismycreditcardstolen.com. \nReference\n\n\nBut you don't even have to send emails to people, sometimes you can just lay a trap and people will gladly provide you with information instead. Here's a great website, \nismycreditcardstolen.com\n. You just enter your credit card information, and it'll helpfully tell you if it's been stolen or not. Of course, as soon as you enter the details, your credit card information has in fact been stolen.\n\n\nBut it has that nice \"Verified Secure\", with the padlock and green tick, so it must be OK, right?\n\n\n\n\nI should be clear that this isn't really a bad website, and is safe to visit. It's made to point out to people that they shouldn't fill in their details on random sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a Debit Card?\n\n\n\n\n025. twitter.com/needadebitcard. \nReference\n\n\nTaking it a step further, sometimes you don't even need to lay a trap, you can just search the internet for the information you want. There's a great Twitter account called \n@NeedADebitCard\n, which retweets people who post pictures of their debit cards to Twitter.\n\n\nIt gets better, because often the replies will be \n\"Looks great, what does the back look like?\"\n, and then they'll go and post a picture of the back too!\n\n\nI really hope none of you would fall for anything like this.\n\n\nThese are all interesting to see, but the type of attack we care most about are the more targeted ones.\n\n\n\n\nReel or Fish?\n\n\n\n\n026. Reel or Fish?.\n\n\nSo I'd like to play a quick game with you all now. I know, audience participation, right? But don't worry, it's a fun game, honest.\n\n\nIt's a game I've called \"Reel or Fish?\"\n\n\n\n\nReal or Phish?\n\n\n\n\n027. Real or Phish?.\n\n\nSorry, I mean \"Real or Phish?\"\n\n\nI'm going to show you some genuine emails that have been sent to employees of another company (shared with the recipients permission of course), and it's your job to tell me if you think it's a real email, or a phishing attempt.\n\n\n\n\nYour account has a debt and is past due.\n\n\n\n\n028. Your account has a debt and is past due.\n\n\nLet's start with this one.\n\n\n\"Our records show that your account has a debt of $436.{rand(10,100)}}. Previous attempts of collecting this sum have failed.\"\n\n\nWhat do we think?\n\n\n\n\nPhish!\n\n\n\n\n029. Phish!.\n\n\nYes, of course this is a phishing attempt. Quite an easy one to spot thanks to the fact the attacker left in their templating code rather than putting in the cents value. But there were some other indicators here too,\n\n\n\n\nA yellow flag in that it said \"Dear Customer\", most emails now will be personalized with your name if they know it.\n\n\nA red flag in that there's a \n.zip\n attachment for an invoice, as these would typically be a PDF.\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, the primary red flag is the templating code.\n\n\n\n\nDocuSign?\n\n\n\n\n030. DocuSign?\n\n\nOk, let's try another one. What do we think about this email from DocuSign?\n\n\nLooks like a genuine DocuSign email, has the usual style, same big \"Review Document\" button. Anything suspicious here?\n\n\n\n\nDocuSgn\n\n\n\n\n031. DocuSgn.\n\n\nThis is another phishing email. If you look closely at the domain name in the email, you'll see that it's not the real \ndocusign.com\n domain, but rather \ndocusgn.com\n (Note the missing \ni\n). An attacker specifically registered a domain similar to the real one, and sent emails that for all intents and purposes look like the real thing, in order to try and steal your DocuSign credentials. Attacks like these are becoming more and more common.\n\n\nOne thing you wouldn't have been able to tell from my screenshot, but would if you were viewing this in your email client, is that the \"Review Document\" link doesn't actually go to a DocuSign domain either. It went to some completely different domain (it wasn't even close to docusign.com) and had some parameters at the end which included your email address.\n\n\nOne takeaway here is to be sure to hover over any links to see the real address they go to \nbefore\n you click on them. Just because the text in the email says one thing, it doesn't mean that's where the actual link may go. Never click on any links in email that are even remotely suspicious. Sometimes all it takes is a click to do bad things.\n\n\n\n\nTop tip: If it\u2019s a shortened URL with bit.ly, you can append a \n+\n to the URL to see where it goes without actually following it.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do accidentally click a link in a phishing email, please let us know immediately, as it can affect how we respond to the incident. Don't lie to us to save face, we're not going to ridicule you or shout at you for clicking it, we want to know so that we can properly respond to any potential exploit that could have happened.\n\n\n\n\nMore Phishing Examples\n\n\n\n\n032. Redacted slides.\n\n\nRedacted\n\n\n\n\nA series of slides have been redacted here. They gave examples of more sophisticated phishing attacks that have been waged against Red Ventures employees, and the indicators we used to detect them. We are not including them in the public version to avoid tipping our hand that we detected them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpear Phishing\n\n\n\n\n033. Spear phishing.\n\n\nThese much more targeted attacks are called \"\nSpear Phishing\n\". An attacker spent a lot of time learning about our internal org structure and crafting a legitimate looking email in order to try and get lots of money from us. These are the types of attacks we care the most about protecting against. Ric recently spoke about an email he got that looked like it was a reply to him from our CFO and the only thing that tipped him off that it was a fake was a subtle difference in the way the \"original\" email was signed compared with how Ric normally signs. You really have to be on your game with these hacks!\n\n\n\n\nPhishing Archive\n\n\n\n\n034. Redacted slide.\n\n\nRedacted\n\n\n\n\nThis redacted slide showed an image of our internal \"Phishing Archive\" where we document all of the phishing attacks against us that we've detected, what the indicators were, and how we were able to detect them (whether automated, or via employee report). We've chosen not to share this slide, again, to avoid tipping our hand on some types of attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtecting Yourself\n\n\n\n\n035. Protecting yourself.\n\n\nSo how do we protect ourselves from this type of attack? Unfortunately there's no golden rule I can give you. It's up to us all to remain vigilant and watch for the signs of suspicious emails. Some things to take care with, the \"from\" address of email can easily be spoofed. There are technologies that can help to prevent this, but they're not implemented everywhere. So while a misspelled domain is a strong indicator of phishing, a real domain isn't a 100% indicator that it's genuine.\n\n\nIt's like postal mail, you can put whatever you want as the return address, doesn't mean it really came from there. (In fact, this used to be an old scam, you could swap the return and mail-to address, mail it without postage, and the post office would return to the \"sender\". I would strongly advise against trying this though, since mail fraud is a Federal offense here in the US).\n\n\nDon't forget that if you get a communication from someone which sounds suspicious, confirm with them via another channel (Slack, etc). Especially if money is involved!\n\n\nAnd if you suspect you've received a phishing attempt, send it on over to the security team so we can improve our filters (and add it to the Phishing Archive).\n\n\nFinally, remember to \nnever click on any links in a mail you think may be phishing\n. Don't even do this to try to get more info about whether it might be phishing - sometimes that click is all that needs to happen for very bad things to happen.\n\n\n\n\nReporting Phishing\n\n\n\n\n036. Reporting phishing.\n\n\nAs of January 2018, if you do need to report phishing to us, use the following process. Within the email message, a \u201cRed Alert\u201d link will be displayed. Ironically, this is blue. Once you get past the cognitive dissonance of this, simply click Report Phishing.\n\n\n\n\nReporting Phishing (2)\n\n\n\n\n037. Reporting phishing.\n\n\nThe email will be removed from your inbox and sent to the security team for review. The security team will notify the end user of the outcome within 72 hours, returning non-suspicious messages to the recipient.\n\n\nIf the phishing message is part of a security-driven phishing test, you will receive instant feedback if the message is reported.\n\n\n\n\nReporting Spam\n\n\n\n\n038. Reporting spam.\n\n\nWhile we're on the topic of reporting phishing, just a quick note that you can do the same with spam. Spam is considered unsolicited bulk email or any email that is unwanted or unrequested by the recipient. These are mostly commercial advertising but may include chain letters, political mailings, etc.\n\n\nYou can report Spam in the MimeCast tab of Outlook if you are on a PC. The Spam you report could be the Spam blocked for the rest of Red Ventures. In addition, you can block senders from reaching your inbox in the future\n\n\n\n\nYou Are Our Greatest Asset!\n\n\n\n\n039. You are our greatest asset!\n\n\nWe don't read your emails, and automatic filtering only gets us so far. It's up to all of you to be able to spot suspicious emails and send them to us. The good news is that you're already great at this! We managed to preemptively block several phishing attacks last year thanks to quick employee reports. Most were deleted from your inbox before you even read them. Don\u2019t assume someone else has already sent us the example, do it anyway. We\u2019d rather have 300 duplicate reports than no report at all.\n\n\n\n\nNot Just Phishing\n\n\n\n\n040. Not just phishing. \nReference\n\n\nSocial engineering isn't just about phishing, even though that's what I focused on here. There are many more types of social engineering attacks we can face.\n\n\nFor example, the meeting invite for this training said that there would be free cake and desserts served. Sorry to disappoint, but that was a lie, and is an example of \"Baiting\".\n\n\nAnother type of social engineering is called \"Pretexting\", pretending to be someone else to get information. For example, let's say you're on the Frontier team and you receive a phone call: \"Hi, this is Tim from Frontier, we're having trouble with the website. I need to speak to our tech account manager right now, this is urgent, we're losing $100,000's every minute here!\", you'd probably say \"Sure, let me put you in touch with her!\", and now you just gave away that Frontier is a customer, to someone who hadn't verified who they are. Very easy to get tricked this way, but very hard to defend against without being confrontational.\n\n\nOne thing to beware of is a forced sense of urgency. In the above example, the attacker threw about the fact they were losing $100,000's every minute, in order to try and add urgency to the situation and force you to make rash decisions. I don't have a perfect way to solve this, just be vigilant, and report anything suspicious.\n\n\nAnother trick social engineers like to pull is to force you into a particular communications channel. For example, if you receive an email claiming to be from an employee, but they say they're out of office and can't be contacted by phone today and would rather you communicate via email. This is why it's important to verify via another channel if you're unsure.\n\n\nOne final example of social engineering would be leaving a USB drive lying on the floor with a virus on it. People love to pick up free USB drives for some reason. Scatter them outside of the office and see if anyone plugs them in, getting you access to a corporate network. If you find a USB drive on the floor and it's not yours, please don't let it anywhere near your computer. Yes, I know we've disabled the USB drives in most laptops, but still. Don't do it.\n\n\n\n\nAsk us!\n\n\n\n\n041. Ask us.\n\n\nAs with anything security related, if you're not sure if you've encountered a social engineering attack, or if you're curious to know more, just ask us!",

I'd start by calling a low-level employee claiming to be a new employee needing help, or I'd call a new employee and claim to be an established employee asking for help. I'd learn some little bits of information, maybe a bit of internal lingo that's being used. Then the next person I call would be slightly higher up the chain, I'd use the information I learned on the first call to sound more credible. And so on and so on.  By the time I call the CEO, I'd have so much internal knowledge and language for the company that it would sound like I was an employee anyway.  This is hard to defend against, since human nature is to want to help others. So if someone contacts you claiming to be an employee, and you've never heard of them before, verify they are who they say they are via another channel.

            "text": "040. Not just phishing.  Reference  Social engineering isn't just about phishing, even though that's what I focused on here. There are many more types of social engineering attacks we can face.  For example, the meeting invite for this training said that there would be free cake and desserts served. Sorry to disappoint, but that was a lie, and is an example of \"Baiting\".  Another type of social engineering is called \"Pretexting\", pretending to be someone else to get information. For example, let's say you're on the Frontier team and you receive a phone call: \"Hi, this is Tim from Frontier, we're having trouble with the website. I need to speak to our tech account manager right now, this is urgent, we're losing $100,000's every minute here!\", you'd probably say \"Sure, let me put you in touch with her!\", and now you just gave away that Frontier is a customer, to someone who hadn't verified who they are. Very easy to get tricked this way, but very hard to defend against without being confrontational.  One thing to beware of is a forced sense of urgency. In the above example, the attacker threw about the fact they were losing $100,000's every minute, in order to try and add urgency to the situation and force you to make rash decisions. I don't have a perfect way to solve this, just be vigilant, and report anything suspicious.  Another trick social engineers like to pull is to force you into a particular communications channel. For example, if you receive an email claiming to be from an employee, but they say they're out of office and can't be contacted by phone today and would rather you communicate via email. This is why it's important to verify via another channel if you're unsure.  One final example of social engineering would be leaving a USB drive lying on the floor with a virus on it. People love to pick up free USB drives for some reason. Scatter them outside of the office and see if anyone plugs them in, getting you access to a corporate network. If you find a USB drive on the floor and it's not yours, please don't let it anywhere near your computer. Yes, I know we've disabled the USB drives in most laptops, but still. Don't do it.",

What are passwords?\n\n\nHopefully you all know what a password is, but just in case you don't, here's a quick definition. Basically they're those things you have to type in all the time in order to do anything on a computer.\n\n\n\n\nT3h 1337 Haxx0rs!!!111one!\n\n\n\n\n044. T3h 1337 Haxx0rs!!!111one!\n\n\nRather than just give you a list of rules for how to pick good passwords, I want to try something a bit different here. I'm going to teach you all how to be hackers, just like in the movies. I'm going to teach you how to crack passwords. Don't worry, I see some wide eyes in the audience, I'm going to keep this as non-technical as I can.\n\n\nI do need to talk about one technical concept first though...\n\n\n\n\nHashing\n\n\n\n\n045. Hashing. \nReference\n\n\n...and that's something called \"Hashing\".\n\n\n\n\n~~Hashing~~\n\n\n\n\n046. ~~Hashing~~. \nReference\n\n\nActually, you don't need to know the name.\n\n\n\n\nMagic\n\n\n\n\n047. Magic.\n\n\nFor the purpose of this discussion, it's \"Magic\". What this magic does is take a password, does \"stuff\" to it, and gives you a magic string of characters at the end.\n\n\nThis magic process has two important features that we care about.\n\n\n\n\nRepeatable\n\n\n\n\n048. Repeatable.\n\n\nThe first is that it's repeatable. If you give it the same password, it will always give you the same magic string. Always.\n\n\n\n\nIrreversible\n\n\n\n\n049. Irreversible.\n\n\nThe second is that it's irreversible. If you only have the magic string, there's no amount of fancy mathematics or algorithms that can get you back to the password.\n\n\nThe only way you'd know that a password correlates to that magic string is if you had some sort of table that stored both passwords and magic strings together and you could see them together.\n\n\n\n\nCreate Account\n\n\n\n\n050. Creating an account.\n\n\nSo why am I telling you this? Well, it may surprise you to know that websites don't actually store your password (at least, they shouldn't). When you create an account on a website, they do this \"magic\" to your password, and store the result in their database instead of your password.\n\n\nWhy do they do this? Well, there's always at least one employee who can see the values stored in the database. If they were to store the real passwords, anyone with access to the database could have them, and not everyone is honest. Well, everyone here is but it's still bad practice.\n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\n051. Logging in to an account.\n\n\nBut if they've only stored the magic string, how do you login to websites? Well, when you enter your password, they do the same process again that created the hash in the first place. They perform the magic on whatever you enter, and get the result.\n\n\n\n\nMatches?\n\n\n\n\n052. Did you enter the same thing?\n\n\nIf the result matches what's in the database, then they know it's you and the login succeeds.\n\n\nWebsites don't really care about your password. They only care that you entered the same thing you did when you registered. So there's no need to store your actual password, they can just store a representation of it, safe in the knowledge that no one can reverse it back to a password.\n\n\nExcept that's what we're going to do now...\n\n\n\n\nEvil Corp\n\n\n\n\n053. EvilCorp customer database.\n\n\nLast night I went ahead and stole a customer database. Doesn't matter where I got it from. For all you know this could be the Verizon customer database, after all I'm an engineer who has access to that, aren't I? (It's not, but if that scared you for a moment, then you should familiarize yourself with our access control policies).\n\n\nThis stolen database contains usernames, password hashes (that's the magic string), and a password hint. Some of you may be thinking that the password hint is cheating here. Websites don't store password hints, right? Well, some do. But you're right, most don't. So you can think of them as \"Answers to Security Questions\" if it makes you feel better (I'll talk more about security questions later).\n\n\nWe're now going to get the passwords for all of these users.\n\n\n\n\npumpkin22\n\n\n\n\n054. pumpkin22.\n\n\nThe first thing you might notice, is that sometimes the username itself can give things away. Let's take a look at this user first. \"pumpkin22\", and their password hint is \"fav holiday\". Hmmm... pumpkins, holiday. I think I have a pretty good idea of what their password is.\n\n\nBut remember when I told you about the two important properties of the \"magic\", the first was that given the same password, you always get the same magic string. So we actually have more information to help us here.\n\n\n\n\narup\n\n\n\n\n055. arup.\n\n\nWe can see that this user \"arup\" has exactly the same password as \"pumpkin22\".\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't always the case, there's something called \"Hash Collision\" which can occur. But I'm ignoring that here in order to keep things simple.\n\n\n\n\nSo now we can use \"arup\"'s password hint as an extra bit of information. So, \"pumpkin\", \"holiday\", \"scary movie\". Hopefully, by now you've guessed that this password is \nhalloween\n.\n\n\n\n\nhalloween\n\n\n\n\n056. halloween.\n\n\nSo there we are, we just broke a 9-character password in less than a minute, without writing any code. Pretty cool, right?\n\n\nLet's try another one.\n\n\n\n\nrich\n\n\n\n\n057. rich.\n\n\nLet's look at the user \"rich\". Their password hint is \"fav person\". Well, that's not really much help to us. We don't know who \"rich\" is, and we have no idea who their favorite person is. In fact, that user probably thinks they're pretty safe, since only close friends would know the necessary information. There's no way a random attacker looking at the database could figure it out.\n\n\nUnfortunately for them, another user has picked the same password.\n\n\n\n\njames\n\n\n\n\n058. james.\n\n\nThe user \"james\" has picked the same password, and has a much more obvious password hint. We can use this information to break the password for both users. Hopefully, you can figure out that the password in this case is \nqueen\n.\n\n\n\n\nqueen\n\n\n\n\n059. queen.\n\n\nSo even though \"rich\" thought they were safe, because of the way this website is storing user's password information, we could use the fact someone else has the same password in order to break theirs. Remember, just because you think you haven't provided much information, someone else may have. I've seen answers to security questions that include the user's password before.\n\n\nAnyway, we've now broken 4 of these 7 users' passwords in less than a few minutes, and we've still yet to write any code or look like cool hackers from the movies.\n\n\n\n\nNo more hints.\n\n\n\n\n060. No more hints.\n\n\nBut now we've got a problem. There are no more password hints to help us. These users have been a bit smarter and not provided any additional information. There are no other duplicate passwords to help us, we're on our own.\n\n\nSo how can we break these? I said at the start that the magic was irreversible, so there's no way to get the password if you only have the magic string. I did give one caveat though. If you already know a password goes to the magic string.\n\n\nI think that a lot of people use numbers in their passwords. Dates, PIN codes, etc.\n\n\n\n\nHashing All The Numbers\n\n\n\n\n061. Hashing all the numbers.\n\n\nSo let's just run the magic on every number from 1 to 1 million. This will give us a nice directory of magic string back to password if anyone is using dates.\n\n\nYou might think this takes a while, and if you were doing it on pen and paper you'd be right. However, we have computers, and they're pretty fast at this kind of stuff. It took my laptop less than a second to get the first million magic strings.\n\n\n\n\nNerd Alert\n\n\n\n\n062. \"Nerd alert\".\n\n\nYou may be thinking the code is complex and you need to be a master programmer to pull off this kind of feat. Alas, it's only a few lines of code in most modern languages.\n\n\n\n\n1337\n\n\n\n\n063. 1337.\n\n\nSo in less than a second of computational power, we've now cracked an additional two passwords. Not bad, right?\n\n\n\n\nsarah\n\n\n\n\n064. sarah.\n\n\nBut now we've got another problem. There's still one user left (there's always one!). Now, we could keep going with our numbers game, all the way up to 1 trillion or further. But let's switch gears. I want to use the same technique, but not just for numbers. A lot of people use real words as their passwords, so perhaps we can try that.\n\n\n\n\nHashing All The Words\n\n\n\n\n065. Hashing all the words.\n\n\nLet's run our magic on every word in the English dictionary, and do the same thing as before. Again, you may be thinking this takes a while, but again, my laptop can do it in less than a second.\n\n\nAnd, in less than a second...\n\n\n\n\nNo luck\n\n\n\n\n066. No luck.\n\n\n...oh, we didn't find anything. That's a bummer.\n\n\nWell, we can keep using this same technique at least. We could try every possible combination of numbers and uppercase/lowercase letters up to say.. 9 characters long. I wonder how many possibilities there are?\n\n\n\n\nTrying everything takes too long\n\n\n\n\n067. Trying everything will take too long.\n\n\nIt's around 13 quadrillion possible combinations. That's a lot. Far too many for my laptop to handle. In fact, it's far too many for most computers to handle in any reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nLuckily for us, someone has already done the hard work.\n\n\n\n\nMagic Lists\n\n\n\n\n068. Magic Lists. \nReference\n\n\nThere are things called \"Rainbow Tables\", in our parlance, \"Magic Lists\". There are massive files that have the full collection of magic strings for all sorts of situations. The one we're interested in is the 4th down from the top, every mixed-case alphanumeric up to 9 characters long. It's a 690GB file, which isn't too bad. We can just download that to an Amazon Web Services instance, and pay by the hour to try and crack our remaining password.\n\n\nAnd in less than an hour...\n\n\n\n\nCracked\n\n\n\n\n069. Cracked.\n\n\n...we'll have broken our final password.\n\n\nPretty cool, right? Everyone feel like a movie hacker now?\n\n\nSome of you may be looking at that password and getting pretty scared. I mean, it's a pretty good password to be fair.\n\n\n\n\ngLCbYt9MX\n\n\n\n\n070. gLCbYt9MX.\n\n\nThere's mixture of cases, it's 9 characters long, there are numbers in it, it's not a real word. The only thing really missing are special characters. I would wager that a lot of you might use worse passwords than this for a lot of things, and thought your passwords were safe. How do you feel about that now?\n\n\nI'm not showing you all this to scare you. Well, I guess I am a bit. But I should apologize, because I've actually let you all astray ever so slightly. The type of attack I just showed, using \"Magic Lists\", is not too hard to defend against.\n\n\n\n\nSalting\n\n\n\n\n071. Salting.\n\n\nThere's a technique called \"salting\" which can stop this type of attack from working. You don't need to know what it is, just that it works, and it's been around since at least the 1970s, probably earlier. (Another one of my favorite stock images by the way).\n\n\nSo great, this technique has existed forever, and stops this attack. So, we're safe? No one would ever not use this \"salting\" stuff on their modern website.\n\n\n\n\nPassword Leaks\n\n\n\n\n072. Password leaks. \nReference\n\n\nUnfortunately not. Lots of companies are using unsalted hashes to store their passwords. Does everyone remember the LinkedIn breach from 2012? I'm sure you all still get SPAM from it. Well, they were storing passwords \nexactly\n how I just showed in the EvilCorp example. If your password was \"halloween\", then what you saw was exactly how they were storing it in their database.\n\n\nThese others here used something called \"MD5\", that's just the name of the \"Magic\" being used. MD5 is older and weaker than SHA-1, which is what I showed in my example.\n\n\nHell, even Yahoo used MD5, they had it in their FAQ for the recent breach. They didn't specify if it was salted or not, which means it probably wasn't.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when passwords are leaked?\n\n\n\n\n073. What happens when passwords are leaked? \nReference\n.\n\n\nSo what happens when these passwords leaks take place? Generally, once an attacker has stolen a database, they'll run it against those \"Magic Lists\" to produce a list of email and password combinations. They might not be able to break all the passwords, but they'll get a good chunk of them.\n\n\nMost people reuse their email and password combinations for other things. So the attacker will start logging into all the other accounts they can, whether it's to steal information, or money. This can all be done \nvery\n quickly after a database is stolen.\n\n\nIt's usually months before the breach is known, by which point it's already too late. Chances are that your account passwords have been stolen. You can check using this website maintained by security guru Troy Hunt: \nhaveibeenpwned.com\n.\n\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that you can't control another website's security. You have absolutely no control over how another website stores your password or protects their database. So you need to protect yourself instead.\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\n\n\n\n074. Best practices.\n\n\nBy following best practices with your passwords, you can massively reduce the chance that you'll succumb to an attack on another website, regardless of how they store your information.\n\n\nIf you use a different password everywhere, then only the password for that service is broken. Since the attacker will likely already have all information stored with that service, they're not going to get any additional information they didn't already have.\n\n\nSo, your passwords should all be long, random, unique, and private. Now, a lot of you will likely be thinking the same thing right now, and I assure you that I'll get to the elephant in the room soon. But first, I want to talk about each of these criteria, and why they're important.\n\n\n\n\nLong\n\n\n\n\n075. Long. \nReference\n\n\nFirst, your passwords should be long. Hopefully it's mostly intuitive that the longer a password is, the harder it will be to break. At least in general. If your password is 20 of the same character, then that changes things a little.\n\n\nIt's worth noting that it's now possible to break 8 character passwords in less than a day with current computation power, regardless of how it's stored. Now, you're average attacker won't have access to this kind of power, we're talking more about nation state actors here.\n\n\nCurrent Department of Defense standards recommend 15 or more characters for your password. I recommend 50 or more. I see some wide eyes in the audience, don't worry, I know what you're thinking, and I'll get to it shortly.\n\n\n\n\nRandom\n\n\n\n\n076. Random.\n\n\nNext, your passwords also need to be random. I've said here not to use dictionary words, but \"dictionary\" is in quotes. I don't just mean the English dictionary. There are things called password dictionaries, too. Remember a few slides ago, I showed you some email and password combinations that had been broken. When big websites get breached, the broken passwords get added to a password list and sorted by popularity. These can then be used to brute force (i.e. try every possibility until it works) other people's accounts.\n\n\nSo while words like \nletmein\n aren't in the English dictionary, they will be near the top of any password dictionary. It's just as important not to use these kinds of words.\n\n\nYou need to make them completely random, and humans are very bad at random. Even mashing your keyboard you're probably alternating your right and left hands, meaning there's patterns that can be implied. Computers are the things that are going to be breaking your passwords, so a computer should be the one generating it, too.\n\n\nUnfortunately, not all websites let you make completely random passwords. Some of them won't let you use certain characters, because of the way their systems work (this is usually an indication they're not storing passwords properly). You need to work within these restrictions, but use as many of the other available characters as you can in your passwords.\n\n\n\n\nUnique\n\n\n\n\n077. Unique.\n\n\nYour passwords should be completely unique. Every single account you have should get it's own password, and you shouldn't follow patterns. I see advice sometimes where you just pick one password, then append the name of the website to it, that way you get a different password everywhere. This is bad advice, please don't follow it. First, if I break one of your passwords, it's trivial to figure out your pattern, and second if you ever need to rotate your password on one site, you're going to have a bad time.\n\n\nYou can't assume anything about how a website stores your password. For all you know they could be storing the password directly (we call this \"in the clear\", or \"in plaintext\"). So you need to use a completely unique password for every single login. Anywhere you use the same password becomes vulnerable as soon as one of those sites gets breached. And remember, you may not know about a breach until years later.\n\n\n\n\nPrivate\n\n\n\n\n078. Private.\n\n\nFinally, your passwords are private. Never ever share them with anyone. Not your loved ones, not your barber, not your Lyft driver. If you do things properly, even you probably won't know your own passwords (I'll get to how in a moment).\n\n\nAlso, you should never send your passwords over insecure channels. Don't email passwords to people, don't send them over IM, or Slack. If we need to share an initial password for you to login to a tool for the first time, we share it using a dedicated tool specifically designed for password management. If you ever accidentally post your password to somewhere that's not secure, you should consider it compromised and change it as soon as possible.\n\n\nAnd finally, we will \nnever\n ask you for your password, under any circumstances. It should be a giant red flag if anyone at Red Ventures ever asks for your password. Never give it out.\n\n\n\n\nTreat passwords like toothbrush.\n\n\n\n\n079. \"Treat your password like your toothbrush. Don't let anybody else use it, and get a new one every six months.\"\n\n\nHere's a quote from Clifford Stoll on passwords which I thought was funny. Although I advise you replace your toothbrush a bit more often than six months.\n\n\nOk, so now we know what passwords should look like, let's look at a few examples of bad and good passwords.\n\n\n\n\nBad Passwords\n\n\n\n\n080. Bad passwords.\n\n\nHopefully it's all clear to you why \npassword\n is a really bad password to use. Please don't ever use it, or any dictionary word. What about the next one though, \nP4ssw0rd\n? The \"a\" has been replaced with a \"4\" and the \"o\" a \"0\". This can also be trivially broken, as these are standard letter replacements and are a widely known technique. This might add a few minutes to the amount of time it takes to break.\n\n\nThe next one is better, \nP\nsSw0~d\n, we've got special characters in there now, and not some standard replacements. But the password is only 8 characters long, and as we learned earlier, that's too short.\n\n\nWhat about \nI Like Rainbows!\n. This is going to be much harder to break, but there are password cracking tools specifically designed for sentence based passwords. You can treat each word here like an individual \"token\", and it becomes similar to a 4 character password (albeit with a \nmuch\n larger alphabet). This will certainly take longer than the others to break, but it can be broken much quicker than you probably realize.\n\n\nAnd finally, \nCorrectHorseBatterStaple\n. This was featured in an \nXKCD webcomic\n a while back as a method for choosing good passwords. Unfortunately, it's not a great password. Mainly because it's already been featured in the comic and is public information. But this is another known technique, and there are tools that can break passwords which are composed of normal words like this. It will take much longer to break, don't get me wrong, but there are much better passwords you can use.\n\n\nOK, so what are some good passwords then?\n\n\n\n\nGood Passwords\n\n\n\n\n081. Good passwords.\n\n\nThese are good passwords. They're long, unique, and random. Although obviously they're no longer private because they're on this slide and you've all seen them, but this gives you an idea of what your passwords should be looking like.\n\n\nAnyone want to take a shot at memorizing these?\n\n\nYeah, that's going to be tricky.\n\n\n\n\nElephant in the Room\n\n\n\n\n082. Let's talk about the elephant in the room.\n\n\nWhich brings me to the elephant in the room. The thing a lot of you have been thinking for the last few minutes.\n\n\n\n\nI can't remember that\n\n\n\n\n083. \"I can't remember that.\"\n\n\nThere's not a chance in hell we can remember those types of passwords.\n\n\nThat's the point. Any password that's easy for a human to remember is going to be even easier for a computer to break. Like I said before, computers are going to be breaking your passwords, so they have to be suitably complex in order to stand up.\n\n\nSo how do you remember all the passwords? You don't.\n\n\n\n\nUse a Password Manager\n\n\n\n\n084. Use a password manager. \nReference\n\n\nYou need to use a tool called a \"Password Manager\". There are lots out there, and you've probably heard of a lot of them. \"\nLastPass\n\", \"\n1Password\n\", \"\nKeePass\n\", etc. They each have their own pros and cons depending on how you prefer to operate. Most have browser plugins to automatically enter your passwords for you (although there have been some security issues there in the past). But they're all designed to do pretty much one thing. Store a lookup of all your usernames and passwords, protected by a single \"master password\", which is the one password (hey, that's the name of one of the tools) you need to remember. The idea is that it'll be the last password (hey, that's the name of another one!) you need to remember.\n\n\nWe use LastPass here at Red Ventures, so if you can't decide on a tool, then you may as well go with that one. One quick thing to note, make sure to use a different tool or vault for your personal vs work passwords. We revoke access to the Red Ventures ones when you leave, so you don't want all your personal ones to disappear too!\n\n\nIf there's only one thing you take away from today's training, please make it this: Using a password manager is the single most effective thing you can do to enhance your security online. Actually, maybe two-factor authentication too, we'll get to that later though.\n\n\nLet's talk a bit more about password managers.\n\n\n\n\nPassword Managers\n\n\n\n\n085. Password managers.\n\n\nPassword managers are designed to remember all of your passwords for you, in a secure way. They can also generate completely random passwords for you, and you can typically change the criteria associated with this generation. So if a website doesn't let you use special symbols, you can exclude those and still get a strong password.\n\n\n\n\nMark's \"Fun\" Tidbit: One of the (many) password restrictions on The US Citizenship and Immigration Service website is \"Your Password cannot contain the dollar ($) sign\". I always thought that seemed a little ironic.\n\n\n\n\nBut the most important feature of password managers is that they let you use a completely different password for everything, without having to worry about remembering it yourself.\n\n\n\n\nPassword Managers (2)\n\n\n\n\n086. Password managers.\n\n\nNow, I'm not going to lie to you. Switching from using the same password everywhere, to using a password manager, is reaaally annoying. It's going to slow you down when you want to access websites, and you're going to have to go to every place you have an account and change your password. It really is going to be a pain.\n\n\nBut it gets much easier as you get used to it, and it is so much better in the long run.\n\n\nI should be clear too, I'm not just advocating for you to use them for all Red Ventures related passwords, you should use one for all your personal accounts too. Amazon, your bank, etc.\n\n\n\n\nEggs In One Basket\n\n\n\n\n087. Eggs in a basket.\n\n\nSome of you may be thinking \"aren't we just putting all our eggs in one basket though? What happens if the password manager gets broken into!\"\n\n\n\n\nTroy Hunt Quote\n\n\n\n\n088. Password managers don't have to be perfect. \nReference\n\n\nAnd you're right, that is a concern. But we're playing the odds. It is much more likely that you will get compromised if you use the same password everywhere, than it is that an attacker can physically take your password manager \nAND\n break your master password. This is why it's important to chose a strong master password.\n\n\nThis quote from Troy Hunt explains it well. Password managers don't have to be perfect, they just have to be better than not having one.\n\n\n\n\nPick a Good Master Password\n\n\n\n\n089. Pick a good master password.\n\n\nBut your password manager is only as good as the master password you pick. So you need to pick a good one, and you need to memorize it. Unfortunately this is one password you can\u2019t store in your password manager.\n\n\n\n\nMemory Tips\n\n\n\n\n090. Memory tips.\n\n\nI have some tips for memorizing a complex password that you may find useful.\n\n\nFirst of all though, make sure you generate a password based on the guidelines we\u2019ve already talked about. It's no good having awesome passwords stored in your password manager if the master password is \nletmein\n.\n\n\nTo have an easier time of memorizing it, try splitting it into chunks of 4 or 5 characters, like you see here. Then remember those chunks. Literally, just sit down and memorize them. You'll be amazed at how quickly you can retain the information. After about 5 minutes, stop and come back to it later, and see how much you can still remember. It'll take a few tries, but it will soon start to stick.\n\n\nAnother tip is to type out the password lots of times in a text editor, in order to get it into your muscle memory. You'll mess it up a few times at first, but quicker than you think, you'll be typing out a 30 character complex password entirely from memory.\n\n\n\n\nBut Wait, There's More!\n\n\n\n\n091. But Wait, There's More!.\n\n\nBut wait, there's more! Just because we now have a good process for passwords, doesn't mean than we're done.\n\n\n\n\nPassword Equivalency\n\n\n\n\n092. Password equivalency.\n\n\nThere's some things that are basically the same as your password. For example, security question answers. If I have that information, I can likely gain access to your account as if I had your password.\n\n\nPersonal information too, since a lot of website will allow you to reset your account based on that information. Does that shopping website really need to know your date of birth? Probably not. Use a fake one and put it into your password manager.\n\n\nTwo-factor secrets are different, they're not equivalent to a password, but I've listed them here since they should be treated as such.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Questions\n\n\n\n\n093. Security Questions. \nReference\n\n\nI'll be honest, I absolutely hate security questions. They solve a customer support problem, not a security problem. In fact, from a security perspective all they do is weaken it. If you ever have the option not to set security questions at all, take it.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Questions\n\n\n\n\n094. Security Questions.\n\n\nUnfortunately most websites force you to set security questions and answers, giving you no choice but to enter something.\n\n\nIn which case, you should never, ever, under any circumstances use real information. There's always someone out there who's going to know that information. No matter how strong you make your password, if you use real information for your security questions, your account is going to be easier to compromise. Treat them like passwords, generate them in your password manager and store them there.\n\n\nMost websites store this information in the clear, despite them being password equivalent, they are not treated as such. Most customer support agents will be able to see them on the screen in front of them.\n\n\nThere's even a slight risk that using randomly generating strings will get you into trouble, as I've been able to convince a support agent in the past that their system must have corrupted the field, which they concurred with since all they saw was random characters. You can't win, so again, we just need to play the odds. It's much more likely that using weak security question answers will get your data stolen.\n\n\n\n\nUnited Airlines \"Security\"\n\n\n\n\n095. United Airlines \"Security\".\n\n\nSome companies go even further with their security questions. Here's United Airlines recent \"improvements\" to their security. Not only do they force you to pick 5 security questions, but your answers must be chosen from a dropdown of choices they provide.\n\n\nNow when you need to reset your password, you are given two of these questions, and the answer drop down for each has 10 possible choices. So that's only 100 possible combinations to guess. The irony here is that they implemented this to replace PIN codes, which were 1,000 possible attempts, for not being secure enough.\n\n\nBut again, they give you no choice here. You can't generate your own answers, and you can't opt-out. Sometimes you just have to play their game and move on.\n\n\nOne thing that stood out about these changes are that United called these security questions \"Two-Factor Authentication\". But that's not entirely accurate.\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication\n\n\n\n\n096. Knowledge, possession, inherence. \nReference\n\n\nYou have have heard the term \"multi-factor authentication\", or \"two-factor authentication\" a lot. But what exactly is it?\n\n\nIn the field of authentication, there are three main types of evidence (or \"factors\") you can provide. These are called \"Knowledge\", \"Possession\", and \"Inherence\".\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Factor In Plain English\n\n\n\n\n097. Multi-Factor. \nReference\n\n\nIn plain English, that's Something you know, Something you have, and Something you are.\n\n\n\n\nPassword, Device, Fingerprint\n\n\n\n\n098. Password, Device, Fingerprint. \nReference\n\n\nSo, something you know would be a password. Something you have would be your phone, or a physical object. And something you are would be a fingerprint, or some other form of biometrics.\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Factor\n\n\n\n\n099. Two-Factor.\n\n\nThe idea of two-factor authentication is that you pick two of these factors, and require them in order to authenticate a user. While an attacker might be able to remotely steal your password, it's pretty unlikely they'd also be able to physically steal your phone or get a fingerprint. Likewise, if an attacker can physically steal your phone, it's unlikely they'd also be able to get your password.\n\n\nAs you can probably now understand, the United Airlines authentication I showed earlier is not two-factor authentication, as security question answers are the same as your password, they're both \"Something you know\".\n\n\nIn order for two-factor authentication to be most effective, it's important not to store the two-factor codes with your passwords. This goes back to that security vs convenience trade-off I talked about at the start. It's very convenient to have them in the same place, but then if an attacker gets one, it means they get the other too.\n\n\nSome password managers let you store the two-factor secrets with the passwords. You do still gain some security advantages there. But it's much better to keep your two-factor codes in a separate password manager. Then if your original master password is broken, an attacker only gets one.\n\n\nThis all applies to backup codes too. Typically you should just print those off and put them somewhere safe. They're your absolute failsafe.\n\n\n\n\nUse Two-Factor Authentication\n\n\n\n\n100. Use two-factor authentication.\n\n\nThe big takeaway from all this, is to make sure you use two-factor authentication wherever it's available. Some Red Ventures systems enforce two-factor authentication, so you may already be used to it here. But you should use it for all your personal stuff too. GMail, Facebook, Dropbox, GitHub, Amazon, etc. They all have two-factor authentication options available.",

Generally, once an attacker has stolen a database, they'll run it against those \"Magic Lists\" to produce a list of email and password combinations. They might not be able to break all the passwords, but they'll get a good chunk of them.  Most people reuse their email and password combinations for other things. So the attacker will start logging into all the other accounts they can, whether it's to steal information, or money. This can all be done  very  quickly after a database is stolen.  It's usually months before the breach is known, by which point it's already too late. Chances are that your account passwords have been stolen. You can check using this website maintained by security guru Troy Hunt:  haveibeenpwned.com .  The point I'm trying to make is that you can't control another website's security.

In a world of mobile devices, we can go anywhere and get Internet access - the airport, hotels, sports venues, and coffee shops. The problem is that this convenience comes at a cost. And information you send through a wireless network can potentially be accessed by someone else.\n\n\n\n\nWireless Security\n\n\n\n\n113. Redacted slide.\n\n\nThere are several ways to protect yourself when using wifi. First, try to only use secure wireless access points. Secure in this usage simply means that you have to log in in order to use the network and that traffic flowing across the network is encrypted. Now, one thing to understand it that there are several different ways to secure a wireless hotspot and they do not offer the same levels of protection. The two primary types of encryption are Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). If you are setting up a home network, be sure to select WPA2 if it is available because it offers the strongest level of protection. WEP is an older technology and should be avoided when possible.\n\n\n\n\nUnencrypted Wifi is Bad\n\n\n\n\n114. Redacted slide.\n\n\nWhen you are on a public network, you should take further steps to protect yourself - especially when you are on open, unencrypted wifi. First, NEVER send personal information across the Internet. Open wifi allows hackers to easily collect the information going back and forth and your information will be compromised. If you really need to do online shopping or log in to your bank account, make absolutely sure that you are on a secure wireless network. If you have to use an unsecured network, make sure you use their secure website.\n\n\n\n\nEncrypted Data is Good\n\n\n\n\n115. Redacted slide.\n\n\nTo see if a website is encrypted, look for the little lock icon near the URL and also look for the https:// before the address. The \"s\" in https stands for \"secure\" and all data traffic back and forth to this particular site will be encrypted. Also, make sure that every page that you visit on the site is encrypted. Unfortunately, some sites only encrypt the login page and that leaves vulnerabilities that can be exploited on the other pages.\n\n\n\n\nMobile Apps\n\n\n\n\n116. Redacted slide.\n\n\nUp to this point, we've been talking about using a web browser on a wifi network. But mobile apps on your phone pose another challenge. In a web browser, you can see if a website is encrypted or not. But when you use an app, there's no good way to see if the traffic is encrypted as the app communicates. This means that you should never use apps that might send sensitive traffic because that traffic could be intercepted over an unsecured wifi connection. In cases where you have to use these apps in public, it's better to use your phone's data network.\n\n\n\n\nCool Kids Use a VPN\n\n\n\n\n117. Redacted slide.\n\n\nHopefully, you are now all terrified to ever use wifi in public at this point and long for the simpler days of ignorant bliss. Wouldn't it be amazing if you could be certain the network you are on is protected? Well, hello, VPN! The Red Ventures Virtual Private Network (VPN) is basically a way for you to connect to our network from anywhere.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n\n\nThe next topic is Personally Identifiable Information, usually abbreviated to PII, or sometimes just PI.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is PII?\n\n\n\n\n120. What is PII?\n\n\nThis is any information that can be used to identify a single person in context. By that I mean, it's no good just to be able to tell that certain data belongs to a single human, you have to be able to identify that particular human out of all the others that exist.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n121. Basic Guidelines.\n\n\nWe have some basic guidelines when it comes to personal information at Red Ventures. First of all, don't discuss company information in public. The number of times I overhear conversations out in the world from folks at other companies discussing things they really shouldn't be is astounding. Please don't do the same.\n\n\nDon't look at information you shouldn't. Let's say you come across a list of employees and their SSN's. That's pretty bad, and is something we want to know about. Don't just scroll through the data and keep it to yourself. Let us know immediately so we can do something about it. Just like with stolen devices, you won't get into trouble for accessing something you shouldn't have access to if it was an honest mistake. But if you look at that information and don't tell anyone, then later we find out you accessed it, that's going to cause problems.\n\n\nAll company devices are encrypted by default when you get them. Don't turn this off. We give you administrative access to your laptops because we want you to have the ability to do whatever you need with them to get your job done. Turning off encryption is not one of them.\n\n\nFinally, we need to be careful with company data. What is company data you might ask.\n\n\n\n\nCompany Data?\n\n\n\n\n122. Company Data?\n\n\nIt's not this type of data. It's the data we store in our systems that allow us to run our business.\n\n\n\n\nData Classification\n\n\n\n\n123. Data classification.\n\n\nWe have three distinct types of data at Red Ventures.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Data\n is anything that is \nintentionally\n available to the public. The key being intentionally. If something gets leaked, it doesn't automatically become general data.\n\n\nBusiness data\n is anything used to operate our business. Examples would be our employee list, payroll information, etc.\n\n\nCustomer data\n is any data provided to us by the customer.\n\n\n\n\nCustomer data is by far the most valuable and protected data we have at Red Ventures, and is subject to our most stringent security rules.\n\n\n\n\nData Handling\n\n\n\n\n124. Data handling.\n\n\nHow we handle data depends on what type of data it is. For example, general data does not need to be encrypted, as it's considered public. All other types of data should always be encrypted in transit and at rest however.\n\n\nYou can view a more detailed description of our data handling policies in our written policies. To request a copy of this, please contact our security team.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Devices\n\n\n\n\n125. No Red Ventures data on personal devices.\n\n\nWhen it comes to handling data, it's important to make sure that certain data never leaves our secured environments.\n\n\nWe do not allow any Red Ventures data to be stored on your personal devices. This means you do not clone a Red Ventures git repository to your personal device, and you do not download sales contracts or employee lists to your personal devices.\n\n\nThis does not mean you can't check your email from your phone. Any website or hosted platform is perfectly fine to access from your personal devices. You should never be downloading and storing anything on your phone that is Red Ventures related however.\n\n\nIf you're unsure what counts as a hosted platform, just ask us!\n\n\nThis is also why it's important for you to let us know if your personal device is lost or stolen, so we can lock it out from all of our services.\n\n\n\n\nRed Ventures Devices\n\n\n\n\n126. No customer data on Red Ventures devices.\n\n\nLikewise, you should never store customer data, even on Red Ventures devices! Customer data is never to leave our production environment under any circumstances.\n\n\nThat means you do not download parts of our production database to your Red Ventures laptops, you do not transfer real production data to our staging or sandbox environments to run some tests, etc. Our production environment has strict security controls and audit logging in place. If you transfer data away from those environments, we lose those abilities.\n\n\nWe have analytics mechanisms available to you in our production environment to run these types of things. If you need something different or special set up for a specific project, please let us know and we're more than happy to guide and help you set that up.\n\n\n\n\nBe Mindful\n\n\n\n\n127. Be Mindful.\n\n\nThe takeaway from all of this is that you should be mindful of how you handle data. Treat customer data as you would want your own data to be treated. Like I said earlier, customer data is our most valuable asset, and customers are trusting us with it. Breaching that trust is unacceptable, and so we all need to make sure we follow the rules.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how to treat certain data, just ask us! Maybe it\u2019s a case we hadn\u2019t considered yet, and something we need to create a policy for.",

This does not mean you can't check your email from your phone. Any website or hosted platform is perfectly fine to access from your personal devices. You should never be downloading and storing anything on your phone that is Red Ventures related however.  If you're unsure what counts as a hosted platform, just ask us!

Compliance.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't know what that background image is about, go and watch a cheesy 80's sci-fi movie called \"\nFlight of the Navigator\n\".\n\n\n\n\nWe have a variety of compliance restrictions that affect how we operate, so I want to spend a bit of time talking about each of them.\n\n\n\n\nGDPR\n\n\n\n\n129. GDPR.\n\n\nThe first one is GDPR. This stands for General Data Protection Regulation and is a new European law coming into effect later this year. I'm required to tell you that this exists, and is a thing.\n\n\n...\n\n\nJust kidding, of course I'm going to go into more detail.\n\n\n\n\nGDPR\n\n\n\n\n130. GDPR. \nReference\n\n\nGDPR goes into effect on 25th May 2018, and has very strict rules for how personal information should be handled, with big fines for those who don't follow the rules. We will be subject to GDPR, as we handle data for users who are EU citizens.\n\n\nWe are mostly considered a \"Data Processor\" under GDPR, rather than a Data Controller. Our customers are the data controller (they control the data of their employees), and we process their data on their behalf. Any customers who are subject to GDPR as controllers will need to execute a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with us if we are to continue processing their data. Since we also have third-parties which process customer data on \nour\n behalf (for example, our notification and telephony providers), we will also need to execute DPA's with them. It's worth noting that there are also a few cases where we would be considered a Data Controller, such as for our UK based employees.\n\n\nWe'll need to include extra steps in our development processes to include data protection from the onset of the designing our systems, rather than something that's added on later.\n\n\nData portability is the right for a data subject (i.e. our users) to receive the personal data we have stored which concerns them. We need to provide this in a \"commonly used and machine readable format\". The user also has the right to transmit that data to another controller.\n\n\nAnother thing GDPR requires is the \"Right to be Forgotten\", also known as Data Erasure, this entitles the data subject to have the data controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data.\n\n\nOne very important part is that we have to specify the intended purpose of all personal data we will process, and cannot use that data for any other purpose. For example, if we specify the intended purpose of collecting email addresses is to send Red Ventures notifications, we cannot then use that email address to send the user marketing material.\n\n\nAnd there are very hefty penalties for any breach of GDPR. 4% of annual global turnover, or \u20ac20 Million, whichever is greater.\n\n\nThere are more things involved with GDPR that I\u2019ve gone over here, such as \u201cConsent\u201d and \u201cProfiling\u201d, etc. The link at the bottom has more information if you\u2019re interested.\n\n\n\n\nDear Santa\n\n\n\n\n131. Dear Santa... \nReference\n\n\nThe bottom line is that GDPR is going to lead to a lot of interesting situations in the industry.\n\n\n\n\nPCI\n\n\n\n\n132. Redacted slides.\n\n\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of standards that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information must follow. Failure to maintain a secure environment can threaten our ability to handle this data, which would alleviate the need for most of us to show up to work tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\nPCI Compliance\n\n\n\n\n133. Redacted slides.\n\n\nMany of the security practices we've discussed are part of PCI compliance, including having restricted access when you come in to our facilities. We also restrict access to all computers and the digital resources on our networks. For most of us, simply following the normal practices at RV ensures that we will be compliant. In fact, this training is part of our compliance program, so thanks for being here so we can all have jobs in the future.\n\n\n\n\nHIPAA\n\n\n\n\n134. Redacted slides.\n\n\nHIPAA\nHIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, mandates the privacy and security of certain health-related information. There are two main rules associated with the act; the privacy rule and the security rule. Basically, the privacy rule outlines what information needs to be protected and the security rule addresses the technical safeguards that must be put in place.\n\n\n\n\nPHI\n\n\n\n\n135. Redacted slides.\n\n\nProtected health information is any \u201cIndividually identifiable health information.\u201d This is any data that relates to:\n\n\n* the individual\u2019s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition,\n\n* the provision of health care to the individual, or\n\n* the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual,\n\n\n\nExamples include many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).\n\n\n\n\nHealth info at RV?\n\n\n\n\n136.
