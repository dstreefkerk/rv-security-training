_137. Would you like to know more?_

And that's it! All of the topics I had. I hope you all learned something useful, and if not, I hope you at least had a laugh at some of the jokes. If you want to know more about any of the material here, or anything security related that I didn't get chance to cover, here are some ways you can find out more.

> What information resources do we have available for people? How do we want them to contact us? Do we have any security-related Slack channels, etc?

### Llama

_139. Llama._

And for all of you waiting for the animal to go with the color from the start, it's Llama. So you'll be getting a feedback survey in a few moments, just enter the color from the start, and this animal, and that will "prove" that you attended the security training for this year.

You'll also have a chance to provide feedback on the training, which will shape how we change it next year. I will assume any negative feedback about my jokes are all in jest.

### Questions?

_140. Questions?_

So with that, I'll open it up to questions. Thanks very much!

> When this training is given in person, we'll have members of the security team on hand to answer questions.
