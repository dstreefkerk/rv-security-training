_136. Would you like to know more?_

And that's it! All of the topics I had. I hope you all learned something useful, and if not, I hope you at least had a laugh at some of the jokes. If you want to know more about any of the material here, or anything security related that I didn't get chance to cover, here are some ways you can find out more.

### Llama

_140. Llama._

And for all of you waiting for the animal to go with the colour from the start, it's Llama. So you'll be getting a feedback survey in a few moments, just enter the colour from the start, and this animal, and that will "prove" that you attended the security training for this year.

You'll also have a chance to provide feedback on the training, which will shape how we change it next year. I will assume any negative feedback about my jokes are all in jest.
